# Rapido-Dashboard
In today's world, people care more about saving time than saving money. Rapido meets this need by offering fast and affordable rides. But just getting more bookings doesn’t always mean the business is making more profit.

This dashboard looks at Rapido’s booking data to answer a key question:

"How much money is the company really making, and what’s affecting its profits?"
We’ve analyzed revenue, costs, and profits across different times, locations, and ride types. The goal is to help Rapido make smarter decisions like where to cut costs, when to offer discounts, or how to improve services—while keeping both customers and the business happy. 
Rapido also takes care of girls' safety with trusted riders and safety features.

## Problem statement:
Why are so few rides getting completed out of 1 lakh+ bookings?

Which type of ride is most used by customers?

How can we reduce the problem of drivers arriving late to improve user satisfaction?

How can promoting popular payment methods and discount offers increase customer usage?

On which type of day do customers take the most rides?

How can customer feedback be used to improve ratings below 3 stars?
